# Unleashing PowerShell in the Cloud with Azure Automation

## Abstract

As more and more of our infrastructure moves from ground to cloud, we need to also think about migrating our on-premise management tasks too. Where should all those PowerShell scripts live and run from?

In this session, we will explore how Azure Automation can simplify the management and execution of PowerShell scripts.

Learn how you can use Azure Automation to automate routine tasks, schedule script execution, and manage resources more efficiently.

We will walk through 
 - setting up Automation accounts
 - creating and managing runbooks
 - integrating with other Azure services
 - handling some common scenarios including calling APIs.

This will provide the knowledge you need to get your PowerShell running in the cloud.
